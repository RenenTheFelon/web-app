I want to upgrade the functionality of the WealthView calendar, Income & Expense tracker, and Net Worth sections so that they reflect real, ongoing financial activity — similar to how I would use them in my everyday life.

The overall goal is to make these tools dynamic and self-updating, not just static inputs.

1️⃣ Calendar & Recurring Transactions

The calendar should display all money coming in and going out — including things like debit orders, salary payments, and recurring monthly expenses.

I want to be able to add a transaction once (for example, a debit order or salary), and have it automatically appear on the same date every month without me re-entering it.

This will make the calendar act like a real financial timeline, showing repeating income and expense patterns over time.

2️⃣ Income & Expense Tracker Integration

The income and expense data should flow naturally into the calendar and update automatically when new recurring items are generated.

The totals and summaries should reflect accurate figures each month, even as recurring transactions continue to roll over.

The idea is to turn this section into a real financial record — something that reflects monthly trends in a user’s actual financial life.

3️⃣ Net Worth Projection

The Net Worth tab should show a clear picture of how a user’s wealth changes over time.

It should calculate how much is being saved each month (based on total income minus total expenses) and show how that adds up month after month.

This should be displayed as a growing, visually appealing graph — representing how a person’s net worth could look over a year as their savings accumulate.

For now, the projection should only be based on savings from income and expenses, but later we’ll include assets like cars or property.

4️⃣ Visual and Functional Goals

The WealthView calendar becomes the central view of financial activity, showing recurring income and expenses clearly.

The Income & Expense section acts as a control center where users manage and review what’s coming in and out.

The Net Worth page visually reflects the results — a “wealth growth” dashboard that feels alive and updates automatically as transactions happen.

5️⃣ Overall System Goal

The whole system should connect together so that recurring transactions update the calendar, the calendar affects savings, and the savings are reflected in the projected net worth chart.

I want this to feel like a complete personal financial dashboard that can be used to realistically manage and visualize my finances over time.
